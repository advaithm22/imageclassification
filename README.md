# imageclassification
Using TensorFlow in order to train a model that classifies images of different retinas and determines based on the image if the individual has diabetes. 
Here is a link to the Kaggle website where you can directly download the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data . However, Google Colab does not allot enough space within the environment to download the dataset, so a different platform is needed. I decided to use AWS's SageMaker cloud machine learning platform to download the dataset and train the model.
