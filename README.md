# imageclassification
Using TensorFlow in order to train a model that classifies images of different retinas, which were initially subject to different conditions prior to imaging. Usage of a convolutional neural network will result in the images being processed, allowing individuals to determine if the retina is similar to one which is possessed by individuals with diabetic retinopathy.
